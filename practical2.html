    <p class="one">Hopes and dreams were dashed that day. It should have been expected, but it still came as a shock.
        The warning signs had been ignored in favor of the possibility, however remote, that it could actually happen.
        That possibility had grown from hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny. That was until it wasn't and
        the hopes and dreams came crashing down.

    <p class="two">Pink ponies and purple giraffes roamed the field. Cotton candy grew from the ground as a chocolate
        river meandered off to the side. What looked like stones in the pasture were actually rock candy. Everything in
        her dream seemed to be perfect except for the fact that she had no mouth.

    <p class="three">Don't forget that gifts often come with costs that go beyond their purchase price. When you
        purchase a child the latest smartphone, you're also committing to a monthly phone bill. When you purchase the
        latest gaming system, you're likely not going to be satisfied with the games that come with it for long and want
        to purchase new titles to play. When you buy gifts it's important to remember that some come with additional
        costs down the road that can be much more expensive than the initial gift itself.
